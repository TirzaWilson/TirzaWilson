Welcome to my Github!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently enrolled at Liberty University where I'm studying to get my Bachelors in Cybersecurity!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Object oriented programming (OOP) using Java, C+, and CSS, and many more!
- ðŸŽ® I'm also workshopping a game from the ground up and soon will showcase here on Github.
- I am in my final strech of my schooling, looking to get into an intership this upcoming summer. I'm a self-starter, highly motivated, and will not stop until the job is done!

I look forward to sharing my journey!
